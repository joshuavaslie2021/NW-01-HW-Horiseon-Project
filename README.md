# NW-01-HW-Horiseon-Project

## Description

Tasked to refactor html and .css in company's website; noticed many styling choices that are now reading much more efficiently/using significantly less lines of code to convey their image.

Updated site's structuring elements, using alt attributes to improve search engine's ability to draw information, and for improving screen reader's ability to locate page sections.

Going forward, styling and html elements will allow ideally ANY developer to be able to understand the pages structure quickly and make changes in a more timely fashion.

## Installation

Changes have been made to company's page and is now live via Github.

## Usage
